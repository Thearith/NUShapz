An Empirical Finding on the Politics of Authoritarian....","Description":" EAI Seminar\n\nFull Topic: Does Public Consultation Matter? An Empirical Finding on the Politics of Authoritarian Deliberation in China\n\nSpeakers: Professor He Baogang (Head of Public Policy and Global Affairs Programme, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore) and Mr Wu Jinjin (Visiting Scholar, NTU, Singapore)\n\n\nAbstract:\nIn the last decade, China has developed a wide variety of public consultative deliberative practices together with authoritarian concentration of power. The debate on the origin and effect of public consultation in China has fallen into two camps: one sees the emergence of local deliberative democracy in China as good prospects for democracy, while the other dismisses it outright. Both camps rely on limited data, case study, or personal impression. This seminar offers an alternative evaluation of these two camps through drawing on a large scale of data collected from 36 cities in China. The speakers will offer an empirical mapping of the general trends and characteristics of public consultation, and test several hypotheses on the determinants and effects of public consultation in China. \n\nAbout the Speakers: \nProfessor He Baogang is the head of Public Policy and Global Affairs Programme at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. A PhD graduate in Political Science from the Australian National University in 1994, Professor He has become widely known for his work in Chinese democratisation and politics, in particular the deliberative politics in China. Professor He has published five single-authored books, and 64 international refereed journal articles, some of which had appeared in British Journal of Political Science, Journal of Peace Research, Political Theory and Perspectives on Politics.

China's shadow banking is intimately linked to commercial banks, local government debt and real estate development. The major expansion in local government debt is the result of shadow banking and worsened by real estate developers. The prosperity of the Chinese economy largely lies on the continuous rise of land prices. The speaker analyses risks arising from both micro and macro levels.\n\nAbout the Speaker: \n\nDr Wan Jing is a Visiting Research Fellow at the East Asian Institute. She received her Ph.D in Economics from the National University of Singapore in 2013, and her Master's in Economics and Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering from Nankai University and Tianjin University, China respectively. Dr Wan's research interests cover macroeconomics, growth theory, endogenous business cycles, public finance, monetary economics and wealth inequality.<br\/>  Venue: EAI Conference Room (NUS BTC Tower Block Level 6)  <br\/>  Start Date: Fri, 24 Apr 2015 15:30:00  ","Category":"Conferences","Venue":"EAI Conference Room (NUS BTC Tower Block Level 6)","DateAndTime":"24 April 2015, 3:30 pm","Price":"-","Organizer":"-","Contact":"-","Agenda":"-","Flag":"0"},{"ID":"69319","Title":"Implications of Retirement Age Extension on Human Capital in China, 2010-2040 ","Description":"-","Category":"Conferences","Venue":"EAI Conference Room (NUS BTC Tower Block Level 6)","DateAndTime":"8 May 2015, 3:30 pm","Price":"-","Organizer":"-","Contact":"-","Agenda":"-","Flag":"0"},{"ID":"68350","Title":"Asian Engineering Dean's Summit 2015","Description":" Engineering Schools around the world are facing new challenges, \nopportunities, and different expectations from stakeholders.
